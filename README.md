# MISRP
Motivation:  Stroke is a disease with high incidence and mortality. Notably, the mortality rate is substantially higher in patients with stroke recurrent than in patients with first stroke. At present, three main problems remain in existing research. Firstly, there is lack of reliable multi-group image dataset for stroke recurrence, making it difficult for researchers to establish artificial intelligence (AI) model. Secondly, there are few AI models designed specifically for the stroke recurrent problem based on images data.  However, most clinicians must assess the likelihood of stroke recurrence based on image data. Thirdly, there are few stroke recurrence prediction models based on multiple omics data. 
Results: Based on these issues, we collected conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and detection data from 602 patients with stroke in Zhuhai, China and after 12 months of extended follow-up to assess stroke recurrence. Then, we proposed MISRP, a Multi-omics Integrated Stroke Recurrence Prediction Model, which is based on Residual Network (ResNet), Long Short-Term Memory method (LSTM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN.) The MISRP model uses ResNet & LSTM method to extract the key feature from omics MRI data and constructs an integrated classifier based on the DNN method. Experimental results show that the MISRP model outperforms the single omics model. The prediction accuracy, AUROC, specificity, and sensitivity of the MISRP model can be as high as 0.96,0.97,1 and 0.94, respectively. We believe that the MISRP model can assist clinicians in diagnosing patients who are possibly stroke recurrence and in designing effective secondary care planning.
